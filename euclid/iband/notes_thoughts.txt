The idea was born out of the sheer inability to fit anything respectfully (language may not make sense, since im a bit groggy) out to only z ~ 0.9.

Euclid SNIa survey out to higher redshifts. 
i-band out to z ~ 1.2
Advantages: bluer than YJH, hence higher z
there is a comparison to existing hubble diagrams
more SNe for the simulations

Drawbacks: More reddening than redder bands, 
higher  intrinsic scatter

look at the redshift range 0.9- 1.2, include i-band there and see how awesome the whole thing can become


result1: 
out to z ~ 1.3, the i-band SNe offer a much needed reduction to the wa-w0 contours from 

there is some reason why extending out to z ~1.7 isnt as good as the other method

i-band survey run out to a redshift of 1.18 with rates from perrett+ and a total of 610 supernovae. 
 constraints on w give out a contour that is significantly smaller than the SNe only contour from the optical surveys like Union 2.1/JLA

Next step:
1. w0-wa contours comparison
2.  how to get the 1 sigma error out of the contour

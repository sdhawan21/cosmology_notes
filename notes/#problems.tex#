this is a short list/summary of the main problems that have been encountered in the cosmology fits. 
each point has the appropriate solutions/trials along with it

1. the w makefile doesn't work.	
	its been re-written to incorporate the template from olom

2. the contour sizes are not improvements on the optical surveys 
	extending the high-redshift arms out ot z $\sim$ 0.9 have shown significant improvements

3. why are the contours discretized?


Observations:
1. fits with dm15=1.1 have a different fit and error than without, eg sn404

2. in the W14 sample SN2011fs does not fit if dm15 is not set. 

3. cosmology must be getting affected by the dm15=1.1 fits. 

run simulations without the dm15=1.1 and seehow it works out
